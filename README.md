Crime Reporting System is a React web app that allows civilians to easily report crimes happening in their community. The app is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for people to submit crime reports quickly and easily.

The app allows users to submit a crime report by entering a description of the crime, the location where it occurred, and any other relevant information. Users can also upload photos or videos of the crime if they have them. Once a report is submitted, it is sent to the appropriate authorities for review and investigation.

The app also includes a map feature that shows the location of reported crimes in the community, allowing users to stay informed about criminal activity in their area.
